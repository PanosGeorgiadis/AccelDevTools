# Code Smells

### `2019.01.29` Initializing class members:

_With a constructor and a member initializer list:_

    struct A {
        A() : i(0) {}
        int i;
    };

_Within the body of the constructor:_

    struct A {
        A() { i = 0; }
        int i;
    };

_Because the constructor body can pretty much do anything, itâ€™s better to separate initialization into the member initializer list (technically a part of the constructor body), i.e. use 1st example._
