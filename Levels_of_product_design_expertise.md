# A simplistic approach to levels of software expertise

I would like to present a naive approach to explain the ways a software engineer is presented with tasks to solve in their daily work routine.

Consider the following customer requirement in a general case where design is not constrained to the software discipline. I am borrowing the example from a course/presentation made by Kees van Overveld at TU/e, OOTI.

Customer: "I want a corkscrew"
At the most simple level, a software engineer is asked to provide a direct solution for a customer, which is to deliver a corkscrew. Without any further details provided, any implementation of a device that can open bottles can be a successful product delivery.

Customer: "I want a corkscrew"
At a more advanced level, a software engineer is asked to possibly engage the customer in an interview to extract detailed technical explanation of the elements of design, for instance:
- how heavy can the corkscrew be?
- what material do you prefer?
- is it for right-handed or left-handed use?
- how small/compact do you want it?

This interview can increase the chance of success of the produced deliverable, and its business value.

Customer: "I want a corkscrew"
At the most advanced level, the engineer is asked to play the role of the "designer", i.e. engage the client in questions that answer another big question of product design, the WHY:
Engineer: "...Why do you want a corkscrew?"
Customer: "Because I want to open bottles"
Engineer: "Why do you want to open bottles?"
Customer: "I have a lot of bottles of wine"
Engineer: "Why do you have that many bottles of wine?"
Customer: "Because I started to drink after my wife left me..."
In this imaginary scenario, the business value is changed drastically because we know the goal of our product (or in UML terms, an actual set of use cases is applicable)
