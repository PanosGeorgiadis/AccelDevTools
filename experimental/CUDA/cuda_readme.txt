# CUDA programming

First things first:
- why do you want to learn gpu programming?
- what have you already heard about CUDA?
- what would a developer need to start

Most (respectable) software development services nowadays offer solutions that do not disrupt the flow, the way of working, or processes used by the developers; in addition, they typically should have an easy learning curve, and be accompanied by documentation and community support; depending on popularity, the last item is debatable, so make sure to choose a technology that is already mature enough.

In order to learn the toolkit, I decided to take a step-by-step approach that closely follows an online course or book reading exercise.
The process in coarse phases:
- find a good first tutorial for a Hello World application
- play around with the existing samples to familiarize with the API and prorgamming style
- start (in parallel) reading the provided documentation
